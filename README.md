# Pixoprint

Static site built with Eleventy.

## Building

Run `npm run build` to regenerate the `docs` directory. The build cleans old files, copies assets (including `assets/js/main.js`), and outputs the site to `docs`. During this step Eleventy copies the entire `assets` folder so the documentation always uses the latest script.
